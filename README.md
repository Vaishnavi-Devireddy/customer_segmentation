#  Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The goal is to classify customers into different groups based on features such as **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**, allowing businesses to tailor their marketing strategies more effectively.

## Files Included

- `Customer_segmentation.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook containing code, visualizations, and clustering analysis.

##  Features Used

- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1–100)

##  What’s Inside

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Elbow Method for determining optimal number of clusters
- K-Means Clustering implementation
- Interpretation of customer clusters

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
